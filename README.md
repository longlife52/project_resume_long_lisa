## Resources
[Here's mmenu](http://mmenu.frebsite.nl/) which is the jQuery plug in that I used to create the sliding menu. Gratefully, Richard problem solved the following issue: to have the href point/work to a # on the same page, a few onClick options needed to be coded in js file to override the default actions.

I used the jQuery plug in [scrollUp](https://markgoodyear.com/labs/scrollup/) to easily create a fixed button that when clicked returns the user to the top of the page.

Researched jQuery api called "one" [here](http://api.jquery.com/one/) to get my custom code to only display on the first click and not subsequent clicks.

Reviewed Box-Shadow [here.](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_shadows.asp)

I used an easy jQuery plugin called [Flip.](https://nnattawat.github.io/flip/) It did not work from the .min.js file. However, it did work with the link for the code.

Here's a quick resource for [growing a hover effect.](http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2014/05/8-simple-css3-transitions-that-will-wow-your-users/)

Here is the jQuery plug in called [Owl Carousel.](https://owlcarousel2.github.io/OwlCarousel2/demos/responsive.html)

## Deductions
I have reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

## Comments
I added my custom jQuery code to my headshot. On click, words appear beneath the image.

I am curious about Adobe Typekit and placing the script in the head tag per its instructions. I am wondering if there is another way since it throws an error in the html to have a script in the head tag.

While this project wore me down with issues and problem-solving, I am fairly happy with the result.

I just wish there was a way to match points better with the divs (see my quad box: education, skills, awards, client focused). I think of it like quilting - and meeting the points is important. Do you have any suggestions for how to better meet the points in responsive design?

In many ways, the things we learned this semester have taken up room in my brain, and I have forgotten the basics (like how to code an email anchor tag!). Good thing there's Google!
