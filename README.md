## Resources
[Here's mmenu](http://mmenu.frebsite.nl/) which is the jQuery plug in that I used to create the sliding menu. Gratefully, Richard problem solved the following issue: to have the href point/work to a # on the same page, a few onClick options needed to be coded in js file to override the default actions.

I used the jQuery plug in [scrollUp](https://markgoodyear.com/labs/scrollup/) to easily create a fixed button that when clicked returns the user to the top of the page.

Researched jQuery api called "one"[here](http://api.jquery.com/one/)to get my custom code to only display on the first click and not subsequent clicks.

Reviewed Box-Shadow[here.](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_shadows.asp)

I used an easy jQuery plugin called [Flip.](https://nnattawat.github.io/flip/) It did not work from the .min.js file. However, it did work with the link for the code.

Here's a quick resource for [growing a hover effect.](http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2014/05/8-simple-css3-transitions-that-will-wow-your-users/)

Here is the jQuery plug in called [Owl Carousel.](https://owlcarousel2.github.io/OwlCarousel2/demos/responsive.html)
