## Project Links

[Here's the link to my Resume on my web host.]()

[Here's the project on W3C's Validator.]()

[Here's the project on the HTML5 Outliner.]()

## Resources
[Here's mmenu](http://mmenu.frebsite.nl/) which is the jQuery plug in that I used to create the sliding menu.

I used the jQuery plug in [scrollUp](https://markgoodyear.com/labs/scrollup/) to easily create a fixed button that when clicked returns the user to the top of the page.

Researched jQuery api called "one"[here](http://api.jquery.com/one/)to get my custom code to only display on the first click and not subsequent clicks.

## Deductions
I have reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

## Comments
I added my custom jQuery code to the image. On click, words appear beneath the image.
